/* This implements almost all the logic required by the 256 kB RAM Expansion for the Commodore 16/Plus 4 designed by
 * Hannes, as drawn in the schematics by Solder/Synergy.
 *
 * The memory of 256kB is divided in 4 64kB banks. You can only use 240kB, because you can't switch memory lower than
 * $1000. A further restriction is possible if you use bit 7. The control register for the expansion is located at
 * address $FD16 (64790):
 *
 * - Bit 0/1: Select RAM-bank (0-3), standard is RAM-bank 3
 * - Bit 4/5: Leave these set to 1 for compatibility with the expansion by CSORY
 * - Bit 6: "TED-feature", added in "Update 1":
 *   - 1: Allows TED access to RAM (for text, graphic) to RAM-bank selected with bits 0 and 1
 *   - 0: TED access to RAM only in bank 3, bits 0 and 1 ignored
 * - Bit 7: Set the switch-bound:
 *   - 0: >$0fff
 *   - 1: >$3fff
 *
 * Note:
 * - At power-on the plus/4 all bits are "1". The standard bank is bank 3.
 *
 * This GAL implements all the glue logic shown in the schematics by Solder/Synergy, *except* the 6529B implementing the
 * control register. Since that IC is not easy to find these days, we use an alternative circuit involving a 74x573 for
 * the write part (a 74x273 could be used too, but the '573 simplified our routing), a 74x245 for the readback part,
 * some pull-up resistors and a NE555 to implement the "outputs-high-on-reset" feature of the 6529 (a 74x74 or any other
 * D-type flip-flop could replace the '555, but I didn't want to have a partially-used IC and I had a ton of '555 lying
 * around). It could be objected that this alternative circuit is a bit overkill as the expansion only uses p0/1/6/7,
 * but a lot of the software already available which supports this expansion seems to read/write the whole 8 bits of the
 * register in their expansion-detecting algorithms, so better play safe. V1 of the expansion only implemented those 4
 * bits though, and all the software I tested still appeared to work correctly. If you are writing a new detection
 * algorithm, I'd recommend to only use p0/1/6/7.
 * 
 * Thanks to Levente Harsfalvi (TLC) for suggesting this replacement circuit for the 6529.

/** Pin Definitions **/

/* RAM Register /CS (handled by HCT138 in the original Hannes/Solder schematics)
 * The idea is to intercept the Userport /CS range ($FD10-FD1F, PLA pin 16) and further decode it, feeding $FD10 to its
 * original purpose and using the remaining addresses for other stuff. In particular, $FD16 will be the control register
 * for our RAM expansion (see ioarea.txt for further address assignments).
 * Note: the Userport /CS range is also known as "Cassette" on the C16 schematics, as it actually has no Userport.
 * Note2: On the +4, the track between pin 16 of the PLA (U19) and pin 19 of the 6529 controlling the Userport (U5)
 *        must be cut and the two sides must be connected to the corresponding pins below.
